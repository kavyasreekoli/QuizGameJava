# QuizGameJava

A Java-based quiz game application built using core Java libraries.  This project provides an interactive way to test Java programming skills. Key features include:
* Randomly generated questions from a pre-defined question bank.
* Two lifelines: 50-50 (removes two incorrect options) and Skip (skips the current question).
* Score tracking with points awarded for correct answers.
* Immediate game over on an incorrect answer.
* Clear rules presentation and player details collection.
 Good for beginners to explore Java development.
This project demonstrates the use of Java fundamentals, including data structures, random number generation, and input/output.
